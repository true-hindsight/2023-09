## Damage Done to Humanity by John Locke and His Followers 

John Locke's ideas about natural wilderness being "rude", and becoming wasted if it isn't put to "good financial use" by slave owners, highlights the pretentiousness of anthropocentric, medieval thinkers. Another problematic idea introduced by Locke was that perishable and less valuable things need to be exchanged with more durable and higher valued things, as a rule. 

How destroying natural habitats using slash and burn techniques have devastated indigenous cultures, is a topic that is still incomprehensible to Locke's followers. Additionally, the fact that "durable goods" tend to be non-biodegradable items that slowly exude toxic substances into Earth's soil and water bodies for millions of years, wasn't, and still isn't, a concern that predatory capitalists can grasp with their avaricious minds. 

Unfortunately for the good of human kind, Locke's erroneous and problematic ideas have remained at the core of government and societal functions of Britain, Western Europe, as well as other Euro-centric regions of the world like North America, and Australia, where ideas from the medieval period centered around worshiping white, male human beings as an "image of God", are still taken too literally and to an extreme. Such systemic and foundational faults have resulted in:

- Ecological destruction in the name of utilitarianism because followers of those bad ideologies do not understand and do not appreciate, the vital qualities of undisturbed nature to all living beings 

- Dumping of e-waste, garbage, and other toxic as well as polluting wastage into regions of South and South-East Asia by Western European and North American countries in the name of "fair trade"

    - Western leaders still find clever "econometric justifications and diplomatic ways", to persuade parliamentary as well as business leaders in non-Euro-centric countries to: "accept and be content with the 'fact' that, beggars can't be choosers", and to be grateful for being given "the opportunity to participate in the global economy" as the world's sweat-shops, land fills, and recycling bins 

    - See for example, World Bank's strategy since 1991 to push dirty industries onto parts of the world with developing economies - https://youtu.be/uyXGgiXW5Qk?si=MrkxEiDz7z8BwKCC&t=1884 


The straightforward solution to the above problems is to, stop taking nonsense and garbage from westernized countries!
