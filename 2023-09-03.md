## This Is Not a Swan Song

Realizing that you have no reason to put up with the abuse being inflicted upon you, by cheats and murderers, is likely to be the most useful, and sane piece of understanding you will ever arrive at. 

More importantly, there is no type of a virtue that allows for corruption and ignorance to spread, or for genocidal activities to continue. 

Upon realizing such basic aspects of daily life, one can directly and publicly ask entities like Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Waterloo Regional Police Services (WRPS), Canada Security Intelligence Services, Communications Security Establishment (CSE), City of Kitchener Municipality, Health Canada, Universities Canada, and the Ontario Judiciary, if there is anything inherently dangerous and vicious incorporated within their very existence, that ordinary people ought to be afraid of, when openly and frankly presenting them hard evidence of malfeasance, among colluding public-service units and private organizations of Canada. 

Federal and provincial governments in Canada might then say, that cases of malfeasance among members of registered organizations of Canadian origin is a matter of investigation and adjudication, for "internal affairs." However, because of the international-scale of the ongoing wrongdoings, which specifically targeted and snared victims who are not citizens of Canada, the highlighted issues are also a matter for independent investigation and adjudication for each of the concerned ministries of "foreign affairs" of the victims' countries. The highlighted issues have been, and are being showcased via online repositories found at the web-addresses:

A number of readers of the above materials might be offended, or taken aback. Some might become annoyed, or even scornful, about "the indiscreet manner" of drawing their attention to pertinent and inescapable realities of life in Canada. But truly, is their form and level of being offended, and of being scornful, about anything, somehow greater in comparison to level of disrespect they have shown to local and international community members over a period of decades, in neglecting and even abetting crimes like the molestation, rapes, and murders of tens of thousands of innocent children, within Canada's Residential Schools, churches, and hospitals? Those types of heinous crimes were, and are still being committed by Canadian state-sponsored professionals in the name of "public service", because news and documentary about them have been continuously downplayed or brushed aside, by Canadian officials and responsible community leaders. 

Likewise, how many acts of infanticide and reproductive harms to parents were committed against immigrants, refugees, indigenous, and first nations peoples through Canada's healthcare services? Zero, is it? How many of those types of medical abuses have continued to be committed by Canadian healthcare units under the guise of therapy? Also none? 

Or how about the issue of women, religious minorities, newcomers, persons with disabilities, and peoples of color being routinely harassed and then being subjected to surreptitiously murderous harms via normalized policies and healthcare practices of Canadian organizations? Absolutely a non-issue, isn't it? 

Will Canadian officials and professional security agencies continue to deny all of the mounting and shameful evidence of those kinds of daily horrors, the same way they arrogantly denied the wrongs that were being carried out in Residential Schools and hospitals? For how long will Canada's harmful and destructive organizations remain comfortably oblivious and patronizingly conceited, about all the violent ways in which they have continued to hurt and injure vulnerable people through brazen human rights abuses? And on top of that, for how long can they pull off their cover ups and cunning ways of dismissing or deflecting the ground-swell of evidence, about their systematic faults and errors, as "absurdities?"  

Now, have any of the successive governments in Canada, at the provincial as well as federal levels, fulfilled their promises to pay for remedies and reparations? They've never made any such promises to begin with? Or have they continued to make pious yet empty announcements, while fecklessly introducing delays year-after-year for decades, in wanting to work towards diligently and sincerely following through with the process of paying long-overdue remedies and demanded reparations, to survivors and victims of Canada's state-sponsored violations, only to then sideline the issue of unpaid restitution with ongoing systemic violations of vulnerable people, by relying on the age-old colonial plan of letting all dissenting persons die in despair, from having been violently wounded, and from still being systematically deprived of basic human rights and equitable remedies? 

You see, I am merely one more survivor, among millions of people throughout the world, who are fed up of Canada's ongoing treacheries and hypocrisy. Like many targeted victims of government-sponsored terror and violence, I too have had to withstand the deadly ways in which North American agents and agencies have dishonorably labeled us as 'mad junkie who lie', while authorized and trained members of responsible organizations have repeatedly harmed and injured our families, and relationships, in evermore dastardly ways. 

So, after somehow having endured those deadly attackers and their surreptitious attacks, I can now ask those North American agents and agencies supported by international intelligence groups, a very simple question: 

>"How can I possibly be mad, or livid, or a liar, if I were just recently [*born, on 31st February, 1903,*](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/01-02-04.md#124-empathy-sympathy-and-solidarity) and have only managed to stay alive all these years since being born at the *25th hour* of that day, because of their daily heartfelt alms and scrupulous gifts of beneficence?"
