## NATO's Patsy

Ukraine had repeatedly siphoned oil and natural gas via the pipelines passing through its lands from Russia to other European countries, since the year 2009. That theft amounted to billions of Euros in loss per year, to the Russian Federation and Republic. On top of that, Ukraine continued to demand increased "yearly transit fees" for providing the land usage rights to Russia for its oil and gas pipeline systems. That dispute with Ukraine was identified by Russian authorities as a direct threat to Russia's economy, national security, and sovereignty, which the European Union (EU) had chosen not to interfere with or get too involved in, during the 2010s. 

European countries like Germany had trade contracts with Russia for the supply of oil and natural gas, which repeatedly fell short of the agreed upon volume to be supplied by Russia because 15% to 20% of the total amount of supplied fuel per year via Ukraine, would keep getting stolen at terminals within Ukraine. Ukrainian officials eventually admitted to the theft but downplayed it, only to then demand renegotiation of the price of oil and gas they were paying to Russia in the form of discounts in fees for land usage rights for pipelines going into European countries. This was because successive Ukrainian governments felt that they were being price gouged by Russia, and that Ukraine wasn't being given a proper discount on price of fuels for usage of Ukrainian trade routes which had facilitated the growth of Russian oil supply networks in Europe. 

By the year 2014, the amount owed by Ukraine was tens of billions of Euros along with the requirement that Ukrainian authorities return the stolen volume of natural gas to Russian state-owned companies. Of course, how was Ukraine going to be able to do that when it had used up the entire volume of oil and gas it had bought from Russia, aside from the stolen fuel? Also, Ukraine neither had the money to pay for new supply of natural gas from Russia, nor did it have any cash money to pay for remedies and penalties for the previous years' worth of stolen oil and gas, which belonged to Russia and was to be supplied to other European countries. So, the decision by the Russian government to annex Crimea by military actions, in order to recover punitive damages for tens of billions of Euros of unpaid debt owed by Ukraine to Russian companies, was a matter entirely between Russia and Ukraine, in which the rest of the world need not have interfered. 

However, from 2018 onward, Ukraine's attempts to retake Crimea by cutting off irrigation water supply to the region, by starving the Russian people in Crimea of drinking water, and by causing human made drought conditions leading to deaths of Russian civilians, escalated the conflict situation in that region to a full-fledged war. Again, that war between Russia and Ukraine had no need for countries like India or Brazil to get involved in, but more understandably, EU countries like Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria had started to become negatively impacted by the growing war situation in and around the Black Sea region. Those EU countries raised their concerns in EU parliament for protection and support, to prevent the armed conflict between neighboring Ukraine and Russia from turning into a much worse situation with the possibility of nuclear weaponry being used by Russia in the region. 

EU countries like Germany were also aware and in agreement with Russia, about how oil and natural gas supplies had been stolen by Ukraine in breach of trust and international laws, but were not in agreement about how remedies and reparations were to be paid by Ukraine for the Russian economy to recuperate those losses. Russia had even gone to the trouble of proving the thefts of natural gas by Ukrainian authorities, and providing conclusive evidence to EU regulatory bodies about how that theft had been conducted by successive Ukrainian governments, even after being justly reprimanded to halt those kinds of misappropriations. But the Russians were not able to arrive at a favorable settlement in that regard, via talks with Ukrainian officials through the support of EU delegates during the years 2011-2015. The EU, continued to be lackadaisical and disinterested in its treatment of that legal dispute and the armed conflict in Crimea, during the years 2014-2020, and especially during the period leading up to the escalation of the Ukraine-Russia war in 2022. The EU, was perhaps too busy to prevent escalations of the Ukraine-Russia conflict during the years 2019-2022, for it was busy dealing with the Covid pandemic as well as the change in administrative powers in the US and in various European countries due to elections in 2020. 

More importantly, US Military's 5th Brigade had been activated and had started training Ukrainian soldiers in Poland, starting in December-2019. American Expeditionary Brigades don't show up in a region to simply sing "Kumbaya" and dance around a camp fire for recreation. Additionally, new military armaments and defense equipment had been pouring into Poland from the US, right after the American military had hastily pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021. This implied that the American doctrine of being engaged in, at least one full scale war and one proxy war, was going to be staged via tens of thousands of American soldiers who had started to get redeployed to European bases after being pulled out from Middle-East Asia. As such, the Russians weren't going to let NATO troupes led by US Military Expeditionary units take over the Black Sea region through a surprise attack via Poland. Then, in conjunction to US military activities in Eastern Europe, all data from space satellite imagery of the region indicated that Russia had started to strategically amass military equipment, and position large platoons at the Russia-Ukraine border in December-2021, for a potential invasion of Ukraine.  

Therefore, the current armed conflict in Ukraine that many lay persons throughout the world consider to be a war started by Russia in February-2022, wasn't a sudden invasion by Russian military as an attempt at a land-grab. 

Throughout multimedia channels across the world, Russia has been painted as a villainous and terrorizing country, by the US and its allied European members in NATO, for "starting and then escalating the armed conflicts involving an 'innocent' Ukraine", in the Black Sea region. The current war in Ukraine has indeed come about through belligerent wrongdoings of Ukrainian authorities in misappropriating tens of billions of Euros worth of oil and natural gas, along with provocations against Russia from the American government and US military activities within the Black Sea region, primarily directed in support of expanding NATO by taking undue advantage of Ukraine's pre-existing modern as well as historical conflicts with Russia. 

In all of this, Turkey has continued to try and remain neutral about its diplomatic stance with Russia and its allies, even though Turkey is fully committed with NATO plans to defend any attacks on members like Poland, Hungary, or Romania. Preventing attacks on existing NATO members by Russia seems to have been Turkey's priority in this escalating situation. However, American and British priorities concerning NATO have been focused on opportunistically gaming Sweden and Norway to become NATO members in order to assert dominance in the Baltic Sea, and that too, very distinctly against Russian peacetime and economic activities via Baltic region trade routes. 

So, by stoking a war with Russia, the US and Britain merely gave Iran greater flexibility around the Arabian Sea, and much greater military opportunities to China, in the entire Indo-Pacific region. Now, America along with its allies are preparing to go into two or more full-scale wars across the globe while sacrificing control over mining of ores and mineral deposits in African countries, to Chinese conglomerates. Food supply shortages in Africa and the Middle-East due to the Ukraine war has also, further reduced America's influence in African and Indo-Pacific regions, but mainly because the previous American government under Trump Administration had decided to cut down diplomatic staff and humanitarian aid within those geographic areas of the world. That treachery of the previous US government against the world has not been properly redressed by the Biden administration, which just might get ousted in the next US elections. 

By handing a dysfunctional foreign-policy to the Biden Administration, along with a set of "Trade Wars" waged against China, Africa, as well as Central and South America, the Trump administration had already weakened America's position in the arena of geo-politics, security, and global diplomacy. 

What's worse, the current American government hasn't been able to repair the damage done by previous American presidents in Africa, South East Asia, and in the Middle-East, only to get embroiled within a colossal civilian unrest and homeland security issue created by Trump supporters, because of the [attempted overthrow of the elected US government on January 6th, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack) by numerous white supremacist and sectarian groups in North America. Coincidentally, it wasn't Putin or any individuals in Russia, or in any other parts of the world, who rallied those Trump supporters to march onto the US Capitol with intentions of overtaking the US federal government via armed insurgency. It was quite simply Donald Trump who summoned his supporters and sectarian groups from across the US to participate in that planned insurgent attack, with the explicit aim of "beheading Mike Pence if needed", in order to retake the presidential seat via force. 

So, these days, the only thing that people in America and most of the world can focus on, is the fact that Russia is bombarding Ukraine and killing innocent civilians including infants and children. Destruction of Ukrainian cities has continued while Ukrainian president Zelenskyy, has been frantically campaigning throughout the world to ask for weaponry and support, to fight off Russian military prosecutions, which Ukraine cannot pay for, exactly the same way Ukraine could not have paid for the billions of Euros worth of oil and gas it had stolen from Russia since 2009. 

>Ukrainian government officials thought they had 'a right' to simply take oil and gas from Russia, by sneakily siphoning the supply of goods being sent to other European countries via Ukraine, because those crooked and incompetent officials needed to keep Ukraine's people alive during worsening winters year-over-year. So, Russian government officials now think that if there aren't any Ukrainians left in lands East of the Dnipro River, Ukraine's government and even others throughout the world, will not dare to steal anything from Russia or Russian companies, ever again. 

Therefore, will Russian oligarchs who were penalized and economically wounded by American and EU sanctions, forgive oligarchs from Europe, Britain, and North America for financing wars against Russia, and for vilifying the entirety of Russian diaspora? They certainly will not do so, definitely not anytime in the near future. Now that the war in Ukraine has been patently turned into a cultural and ethnic one by governments and corporate leaders of North America and Western Europe, against all of Russian culture and history, the Russians aren't going to forgive anybody who panders to governments of the EU, the UK, or the USA, for any reasons. 

Supporting Russia as an ally is only something that countries like Belarus, China, and North Korea can do at the moment. Being neutral with Russia as well as with its enemies is necessary for sensible countries. Being neutral does come with its costs, but being friendly or hostile with Russia, as well as being hostile or friendly with NATO, creates much more problematic challenges for countries throughout the world. 

One would think that government officials along with multimedia corporations from the US, Canada, Australia, UK, and the EU would be sufficiently wise and educated, not to do ignorant and hideously bigoted things like demonizing Muslims, Arabs, Palestinians, Persians, Saharan and Sub-Saharan African peoples, Chinese Asians, Central and South American populations, Russians, as well as cordoning India and Indians with "white picket fences"; all the while pejoratively undermining and marginalizing everybody else in Africa, Asia, and Oceania as ragged groups of sickly poor people. But then, what else was actually going to come out of Euro-Centric ideologies still being promoted by westernized governments and media corporations, especially with their aim of permanently establishing the uni-polar global supremacy of, "The Global North?"
